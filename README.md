# structviewer - Windows utility to iterate through other process structure

This is an internal tool with hardcoded paths is should iterate through.
Therefore it its not really useful to other projects than mine.
However published for reference reasons.

Structviewer displays structural values (fields/ptrs) of an hardcoded structure in 'external' processes.
It can also jump to different structs following ptrs from its parent structure.

Build and utilized on Windows in the MingW environment.
